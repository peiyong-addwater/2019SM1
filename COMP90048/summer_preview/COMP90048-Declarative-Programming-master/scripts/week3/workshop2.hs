-- Question 1
{-Give a high level description (not programming language specific)
of at least five different possible representations of playing cards
from a standard 52 card deck. Describe the advantages and disadvantages
of each representation.

The suits are clubs, diamonds, hearts and spades, and the 13 ranks in
each suit are the 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, jack, queen, king and ace.
In this question, we ignore jokers.-}
data Card = Card Suit Rank
data Suit = Hs | Ds | Ss | Cs
type Rank = Int

-- Question 2
{-
Define a Haskell type for representing "font" tags in HTML. A font tag
can specify zero or more of the following: the size in points (e.g. 10),
the face (e.g. "courier") and the colour. The colour can be described
using a colour name (e.g., "red"), a six−digit hexidecimal number
(e.g. #02EA1F) or a RGB triple of numbers (e.g. rgb(255,100,0)).
-}
type Font_tag = [Font_specifier]
data Font_specifier
    =  Size Int
    | Face String
    | Colour Colour

data Colour = Name String | Hexidecimal Int | RGB (Int, Int, Int)


-- Question 3
{-
Implement a function ’factorial’ that computes the factorial of a given
integer.  Include a type declaration.
-}

factorial :: Int -> Int

factorial 0 = 1
factorial n = n * factorial (n - 1)


-- Question 4
{-
Implement a function ’myElem’ which returns True if a given item is 
present in a given list.  Include a type declaration.
-}

myElem :: Eq t => t -> [t] -> Bool

myElem _ [] = False
myElem n (x:xs)
    | n == x = True
    | otherwise = myElem n xs


-- Question 5
{-
Implement a function ’longestPrefix’ which returns the longest common prefix
of two lists. ie: When applied to "extras" and "extreme", the function
should return "extr".
-}

longestPrefix :: [Char] -> [Char] -> [Char]

longestPrefix _ [] = []
longestPrefix [] _ = []
longestPrefix (a:as) (b:bs)
    | a == b = [a] ++ longestPrefix as bs
    | otherwise = []


-- Question 6
{-
Without necessarily understanding the code, translate the following
C function into Haskell.
int mccarthy_91(int n)
{
    int c = 1;
    while (c != 0) {
        if (n > 100) {
            n = n − 10;
            c−−;
        } else {
            n = n + 11;
            c++; }
        }
    }
    
    return n;
}
-}


mccarthy_91 :: Int -> Int

mccarthy_91 n = mywhile (1, n)

mywhile x =
   if cond x then mywhile (next_version_of x)
   else final_version_of x

cond (c,n) = c /= 0
next_version_of (c,n) =
   if n > 100 then (c-1, n-10) else (c+1, n+11)
final_version_of (c,n) = n

-- Question 7
{-
Write a Haskell function which takes two integers, min and max, and
returns a list of integers from min to max, inclusive.  Note there are
two different strategies to solve this problem: we can build up the list
from min to max or backwards, from max to min.  How does your Haskell
code compare with a version in an imperative language such as C, and how
would you reason about the correctness of a C version?
-}

minToMax :: Int -> Int -> [Int]

minToMax min max
    | min > max = []
    | otherwise = [min] ++ minToMax (min + 1) max
